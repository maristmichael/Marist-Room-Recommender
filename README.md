# Marist Room Recommender
This is a repository containing a co-created web application system for my Software Development II class.



The application is a mock dorm reservation system for Marist College. A student who would like to live on campus
can sign up or login and make a reservation for their desired on-campus housing. The student can also view or delete their
existing reservation or view their profile. There are also administrators who can manage residence areas, manage students,
and manage reservations.

This web application uses a LAMP stack. It was written with PHP and HTML using an Apache webserver and uses MySQLi with 
phpMyAdmin is the database management system. The application created and tested on Cloud9 which is a development 
environment in the cloud which consists of an IDE and an Ubuntu workspace.
